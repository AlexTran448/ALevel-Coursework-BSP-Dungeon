# OCR A Level Project
A Level Project that utilises Binary Space Partition to create dungeons with well spaced rooms.
Dungeon places entrance and exit such that the minimum room (Acording the Dijkstra Algorithm (Cost between rooms = 1).

Algorithm:
Take a rectangular room.
Split the room until it approaches the minimum allowed area.
The probability any given area is split is given by the normal distribution.
